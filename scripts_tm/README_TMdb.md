Database is downloaded from OPM database at 20220131. the pdb is orientated in the database.

We first focus on Transmembrane Proteins 1. Alpha-helical polytopic 2.Bitopic proteins. 

We filter by (resolution <= 3.5) and (aa exists between -10 <= z-axis <=10 to remove surface protein) 

We then cut the protein tm domain (-19 <= z-axis <=19).
